# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!
Iâ€™m a web developer in Sweden and Iâ€™m curious about both design and front-end web development. I have been interested in coding from 2013 and always interested in improving my coding magicâœ¨. Something I like to do when Iâ€™m not coding is to bike a lotðŸš². 

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Iâ€™m currently studying web development in the writing moment. We have learned many languages like PHP, Laravel, React, NEXT.js, TypeScript, Node.js, SQL and GraphQL. Then we have learned some CMS like Sanity and DatoCMS.

# ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
You can ask me anything related to front-end and web design. I will be super happy to answer all your questions.

# ðŸ“« How to reach me:
You can reach me on one of these ways. Perhaps we can take a fika ðŸ¥¨ and talk about web development and the future of AI.
